# BBL-Score-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the final innings score in Big Bash League (BBL) matches using machine learning. By analyzing historical ball-by-ball data from the 2011â€“2019 seasons, the model estimates how many runs a team is likely to score given the current match conditions such as overs bowled, runs scored, and wickets lost. The prediction logic is similar to the approach used in professional sports analytics and broadcasting systems.

The project is developed using Python and key libraries like scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and ipywidgets. It features an interactive widget-based interface that allows users to input match details such as the batting and bowling teams, venue, runs, wickets, and overs completed. Upon submission, the trained model instantly predicts the likely final score, making it useful for real-time scenarios or analysis.

The Python notebook (.ipynb) includes all the code for building and running the score prediction model. The .csv files are the datasets used, containing historical BBL match and delivery-level data.
